 ./curveplus_run.sh B_Seq1.pdb huh huh

1 oct 2019
Now, the ideal coordinates are fine and the code only works for nc format. 
tested well 
Althogh there is some spacing difference in the curve+ format and cgFrame format. 

There are two idel base file : ideal_base.txt which correponds to rotated version of curve_ coordintes and
then there is ideal_bases_Tsukuba.txt which are tsukuba coordinates. 

ALso, remember in PDB format or in general always give the proper full PDB file..
use this code to add atom type ...
Also, remove all TER and END before this
import pandas as pd
pdb = pd.read_csv('2r1j_H.pdb', delim_whitespace=True,header=None)


Here is the thing: 
When you fit frame in Phosphate: it requires 5 atoms, namely, OP1, OP2, P, O5', and O3'. 
So, for example, if you want to fit the frame in nth phosphate, then OP1, OP2, P, and O5' should come from nucleotide nth in contrast O3' comes from nucleotide n-1. (see picture below) 
I am bit worried about this as this bug as phosphates variables are large and this might get unnoticed. Could you please confirm this? I am sure you are doing it correctly, I am just a bit paranoid. Sorry for the trouble. 
Have a look at this picture below.
